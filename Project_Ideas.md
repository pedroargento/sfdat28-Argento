## **Capstone Project Ideas**

1.  Movie Scripts:
 Data from: [Internacional Movie Script Database](http://www.imsdb.com)

  * A lot of hollywood movies fail to break even. Is it possible to forecast movie revenue based on the script, actors, director and other pre-production features? With this information it would be possible to budget the movie 

  * Unsupervised machine learning to cluster and segment scrips. Can we find new movie genres from it? Given a new scrip, is it possible to associate with an existing one or with combination of them?

  * Will a new scrip be nominated to an official award (eg. Oscars)?

2. Public construction in Brazil: Data from: [Governamental Data](dados.gov.br)
 
  * Can we predict how many time it will take to conclude a public construction work?

3. Consumer complaints: Data from: [Governamental Data](dados.gov.br)

  * Can we predict how many days it takes for a company to answer and solve a complaint? What is the probability that one complaint will be solved?
